## Description

![L√©gende](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/RoyFramery_4_16072021/blob/master/Logo.png)

üéÆ	__*GameOn*__ is the forth project I made during this training. As a fresh junior developer, the goal üéØ was to continue the work done by a previous developer who left the company, and thus complete the front-end from his [repository](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/). Moreover, I had at my disposal the [mock-ups](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/RoyFramery_4_16072021/blob/master/maquettes.png) as well as a list of issues and contraints:

### Issues
- [x] [TODO : Close modal](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/issues/1) ‚úñÔ∏è
        
    Add functionality to the button (x)  
  
- [x] [Impl√©menter entr√©es du formulaire](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/issues/2) üßæ		

     - Link labels to entries in the HTML using the "for" and "id" attributes in the existing code. Correct the HTML code when necessary.
     - Use pure JavaScript (not jQuery) to finish the form :

         - The form must be valid when the user clicks on "Submit".
         - Data must be entered correctly :
           1.  The First Name field has a minimum of 2 characters / is not empty.
           2.  The Last Name field has a minimum of 2 characters / is not empty.
           3.  The email address is valid.
           4.  For the number of contests, a numerical value is entered.
           5.  A radio button is selected.
           6.  The general conditions box is checked, the other box is optional / can be left unchecked.
        - Keep the form data (do not delete the form) when it does not pass validation.

- [x] [Add validation ‚úîÔ∏è or error messages ‚ùå](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/issues/3)
   
    Specific error messages should appear below the incorrect entry. The error messages should appear below the associated input field. Examples :

    - "Please enter 2 or more characters for the name field."
    - "You must choose an option."
    - "You must verify that you agree to the terms and conditions."
    - "You must enter your date of birth."
  
- [x] [Add confirmation when sending successfully](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/issues/4) üëå	

    After a successful validation, include a confirmation message of the successful submission for the user (e.g., "Thank you! Your reservation has been received.")

- [x] [Manual testing](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR/issues/5) ‚å®Ô∏è	

     - Visualize and test the user interface in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, as well as in the mobile and desktop versions. Correct existing display errors.
     - Test all functionality of buttons and form entries (test for correct and incorrect values)

### Contraints
  - work on a forked GitHub repository
  - use separate files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - always comment your code (describe each function and each class, as well as the parts of the code that need more details)
  - manually test functionality, form entries and responsive display.
